<h1>This the first website that I created while learning the base of HTML.</h1>


The main focus was to try to reproduce the idea of a CV. 
Having a main page that linked two others.

The structure is quite simple : 
- Home page 
    <p>
    Those were the very first steps in webdev, needed to understand the structure of a page and how to go along with it. 
    Add text, some basic element of style and learn to work with link inside of your website.
    </p>
    
- Hobby page
    <p>
    Learn how to create a list and link an exxternal website, here an Instagram page. 
    </p>
- Contact page
    <p>
    Again the focus was create a link to an external website, another Instagram account here. 
    The special element of this page was learn how to add form. Needed to make it reconize what kind of element where necessary, eg : the structure of an email (xxx@xx.xx).
    And make the form effective to send the actual content. 
    The checkbox for the newsletter is just a practice and doesn't link to anything.
